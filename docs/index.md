Welcome. This is a personal website built on top of [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/getting-started/).

Hi! My name is Diogo Andr√©. I'm currently pursuing a PhD in Nanoelectronics under a mixed-scholarship at NOVA University of Lisbon, School of Science and Technology (Monte da Caparica, Portugal), and TU Delft, Bioelectronics Group (Delft, The Netherlands). I'm specialising in Analog / Mixed-Signal IC Design, focusing on Analog Front-Ends and Quantizer ASIC Interfaces for Ultrasound Imaging Transducer Arrays. I am also a big fan of using C-lang and Python to develop my own tools for automatic layout design and custom extractors for parasitic passive lumped elements and crosstalk between signal lines. Feel free to contact me!

## üî¨ Projects  
### [novaad](https://github.com/das-dias/novaad)  
*Open-Source Software Contribution*  
- A Python tool for Look-up Table (LUT)-based Gm/Id Analog IC design.

### [gdsfactory/gplugins/spice](https://github.com/gdsfactory/gplugins/tree/main/gplugins/spice)  
*Open-Source Software Contribution*  
- A Python library for converting between YAML Markup language and SPICE schematic netlist description language.  
`This tool explores the use of modern computer Markup language YAML to represent schematic netlists, allowing for integrated photonic and electronic schematics to co-exist and relate to each other in a single human-readable file. YAML has also readily available Serializer/Deserializer parsers for most common programming languages (C++, C, Python, Ruby, Go, ...).`

- *Important Note:* both the base source code for the `gdsfactory/gplugins/spice` and `gdsfactory/gplugins/vlsir` tools were initially aggregated into a personal repository of mine - [`parcirc`](https://github.com/gdsfactory/gplugins/pull/77#issuecomment-1706780185).

### [gdsfactory/gplugins/vlsir](https://github.com/gdsfactory/gplugins/tree/main/gplugins/vlsir)  
*Open-Source Software Contribution*  
- A Python library for converting between Klayout's DB Netlist format and other electrical schematic file formats (SPICE, Spectre, Xyce)  
- More about the tool at: [gdsfactory.github.io/gplugins/notebooks/vlsir_netlist](https://gdsfactory.github.io/gplugins/notebooks/vlsir_netlist.html)  
`This work is supported and inspired by Dan Fritchman's VLSIR Tools work, linking the way PDK information is represented in the older, closed-source custom filesystem formats to new, open-source, supported and maintained file and binary formats that allow for a greater information compression and inter-programming language data-structure sharing and interpretation through the use of Google's Protobuf data interface protocol.` I highly encourage you to read more about [Dan Fritchman's work](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2023/EECS-2023-275.html).
