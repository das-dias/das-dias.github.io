Hi! My name is Diogo André. I'm currently pursuing a PhD in Nanoelectronics under a mixed-scholarship at NOVA University of Lisbon, School of Science and Technology (Monte da Caparica, Portugal), and TU Delft, Bioelectronics Group (Delft, The Netherlands). I'm specialising in Analog / Mixed-Signal IC Design, focusing on Analog Front-Ends and ASIC Interfaces for Ultrasound Imaging Transducer Arrays. I am also a big fan of using C-lang and Python to develop my own tools for automatic layout design and custom extractors for analysing parasitic passive lumped elements and crosstalk between signal lines. Feel free to contact me!

## 🔬 Projects  
### [novaad](https://github.com/das-dias/novaad)  
*Open-Source Software Contribution*  
- A Python tool for Look-up Table (LUT)-based Gm/Id Analog IC design.

### [gdsfactory/gplugins/spice](https://github.com/gdsfactory/gplugins/tree/main/gplugins/spice)  
*Open-Source Software Contribution*  
- A Python library for converting between YAML Markup language and SPICE schematic netlist description language.  
`This tool explores the use of modern computer Markup language YAML to represent schematic netlists, allowing for integrated photonic and electronic schematics to co-exist and relate to each other in a single human-readable file. YAML has also readily available Serializer/Deserializer parsers for most common programming languages (C++, C, Python, Ruby, Go, ...).`

- *Important Note:* both the base source code for the `gdsfactory/gplugins/spice` and `gdsfactory/gplugins/vlsir` tools were initially aggregated into a personal repository of mine - [`parcirc`](https://github.com/gdsfactory/gplugins/pull/77#issuecomment-1706780185).

### [gdsfactory/gplugins/vlsir](https://github.com/gdsfactory/gplugins/tree/main/gplugins/vlsir)  
*Open-Source Software Contribution*  
- A Python library for converting between Klayout's DB Netlist format and other electrical schematic file formats (SPICE, Spectre, Xyce)  
- More about the tool at: [gdsfactory.github.io/gplugins/notebooks/vlsir_netlist](https://gdsfactory.github.io/gplugins/notebooks/vlsir_netlist.html)  
`This work is supported and inspired by Dan Fritchman's VLSIR Tools work, linking the way PDK information is represented in the older, closed-source custom filesystem formats to new, open-source, supported and maintained file and binary formats that allow for a greater information compression and inter-programming language data-structure sharing and interpretation through the use of Google's Protobuf data interface protocol.` I highly encourage you to read more about [Dan Fritchman's work](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2023/EECS-2023-275.html).
